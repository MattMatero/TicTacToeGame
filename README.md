A Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows the user to play against a computer. You can select who goes first/second by choosing your shape(X or O); X will always go first. For win detection after each move the board is checked for any lines that intersect with the last move made and the diagonals. This is done to ensure proper win/loss on diagonal plays. It will then check if any of those lines contain all three of the same shape.
